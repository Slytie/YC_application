class ProbabilisticMapper:
    """
    A class that maps an arbitrary set of causes and effects using probabilistic programming. The cause set and effects
    set are both represented as probabilistic variables, and the `map` method allows for the convolution of the cause
    variables into the effect variables using an arbitrary function. Additionally, the class includes a method to learn
    the map from data, or input the relations to give a different set of effect predictions.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    None

    Attributes:
    -----------
    cause_structure: dict
        A dictionary that maps cause variables to their respective distributions.
    effect_structure: dict
        A dictionary that maps effect variables to their respective distributions.
    convolution_function: function
        An arbitrary function that takes in a cause variable and an effect variable and returns a convolved effect
        variable.

    Methods:
    --------
    map(causes)
        Maps a set of causes to their respective effects using the cause and effect distributions specified in the
        `cause_structure` and `effect_structure` attributes. If a `convolution_function` is provided, it is applied to
        the cause and effect variables.
    learn_map(data, num_samples=1000, num_steps=1000)
        Learns the cause-effect mapping from data using probabilistic programming. The `data` argument should be a
        dictionary that maps cause variables to their corresponding effect variables. The `num_samples` and `num_steps`
        arguments control the number of samples and optimization steps used during training.
    input_map(cause_structure, effect_structure)
        Inputs the cause-effect mapping manually by specifying the cause and effect distributions in the
        `cause_structure` and `effect_structure` attributes.

'''
This implementation uses the Pyro probabilistic programming library to define and sample from the distributions 
over the cause and effect variables. The `map` method takes a list of cause variables and returns a tensor containing 
the corresponding effect variables. The `learn_map` method uses Pyro's stochastic variational inference (SVI) algorithm
to learn the cause-effect mapping from data, and the `input_map` method allows for manual specification of the cause 
and effect distributions.

Note that the implementation allows for a high degree of flexibility in the specification of
